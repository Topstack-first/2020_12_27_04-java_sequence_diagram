They are sequence diagrams in Visual Paradigm easy to java code in Netbeans. 
The project is almost done, just add that code and make it work. 
I attach a diagram, it would be 2 diagrams.

the real max time is monday 9am
spanish hour

so you think you can do it? :))
I can send you all the info
let me know. Is "easy" but...as is a stupid university project (a part of it just).
but I need it for monday at 9am spanish hour
by the way is in spanish..could you?

in lib.zip there is jcalendar libs for netbeans used
and in the other -zip there is one document trying to explain what I need
I have another zip with all diagrams images in case you want to see sth. and the Visual Paradigm file

but uhmm is very intuitive..useing "activa" like active, experta (person girl expert).
and "Actualizar" is update

basically I need the part of the code of "DarDeBaja" related to "Baja" button from "DarDeBaja" diagram. 
That diagram I think is correct or almost correct. 
if implemeting it you see you need to modify sth do it and later I modify the diagram

and the Actualizar Experta diagram code related to the button "Actualizar". 
I have images from other group what sent me those diagrams and are correct 100% 
but using another names a bit different but using our struct names, etc should work
so in the document is basically all needed. there as extra the images in better quality (still not the best I know) 
and the netbeans projhect is called "ciclo2-05"
in the 1st zip

sth very important the diagrams for "actualizar" (update) and to activate or inactivate an "experta" are from 
other group so the names can be a bit different and 
I should send you those diagrams adapted to our names of our class diagrams..
I will do tonight so is all more clear to pass it to the code in netbeans.
so start for DarDeBaja slightly smiling face emoji and remember to write whatever change you see in the code so I will modify the diagram later
